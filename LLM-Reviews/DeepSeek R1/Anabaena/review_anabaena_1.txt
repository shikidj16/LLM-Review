## Abstract

The impending era of interplanetary exploration, targeting sustained human presence on the Moon and Mars, necessitates a paradigm shift from purely physical-chemical life support systems to bioregenerative solutions. These systems must efficiently recycle waste, produce oxygen and nutrition, and manufacture biomaterials *in situ* to achieve closure of mass loops and reduce Earth-dependence. While heterotrophic microorganisms like *Escherichia coli* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* have been the workhorses of terrestrial biotechnology, their utility in space is limited by their high dependency on supplied organic substrates. This review posits the filamentous, diazotrophic cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7938 (and related strains) as a premier photosynthetic chassis for space biomanufacturing. We critically evaluate its innate advantages, including oxygenic photosynthesis, atmospheric nitrogen fixation, and polyextremotolerance. We synthesize recent progress in the genetic toolkits developed for Anabaena  *, enabling the targeted production of bioplastics, nutritional supplements, and pharmaceuticals. A comparative analysis with other proposed microbial chassis highlights the unique synergies Anabaena offers for integration into life support systems. We further identify key knowledge gaps concerning its long-term physiological stability in microgravity and under ionizing radiation, and the engineering challenges of scalable photobioreactor operation in extraterrestrial environments. Finally, we provide a forward-looking perspective on the integration of engineered Anabaena strains into a circular space bioeconomy, outlining a roadmap for research and development over the next decade.

## 1. Introduction: The Case for Biological *In-Situ* Resource Utilization (Bio-ISRU)

The ambition of establishing a long-term human presence on the Moon and Mars is fundamentally constrained by the immense cost and logistical infeasibility of continuously supplying all necessary consumables from Earth [1]. The concept of "living off the land," or *in-situ* resource utilization (ISRU), is therefore a cornerstone of all credible exploration architectures. Traditional ISRU focuses on the physical and chemical processing of regolith to extract water and oxygen [2]. However, these approaches do not address the full spectrum of human needs, particularly the sustainable production of food, complex pharmaceuticals, and structural materials.

Bio-ISRU leverages biological systems to convert space-available resources—primarily planetary atmospheres (CO₂ on Mars, ~96%; N₂ on both Mars and Moon), regolith-derived water, and solar energy—into critical products [3]. This approach promises to create a regenerative, or closed-loop, life support system, dramatically enhancing mission sustainability and resilience [4]. Early life support research, such as the NASA-led Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) program, demonstrated the potential of higher plants but also revealed their significant challenges: high energy and mass requirements for lighting, large cultivation volumes, and sensitivity to environmental perturbations [5].

Microbial platforms offer a complementary, and in some cases superior, alternative due to their high growth rates, genetic tractability, and operational flexibility [6]. To date, most synthetic biology efforts for space have focused on heterotrophic chassis organisms, which require a supply of fixed carbon (e.g., sugars). This creates a critical dependency; the feedstock must either be transported or produced by another system, undermining the goal of resource closure [7].

In this context, cyanobacteria emerge as a uniquely powerful solution. As prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, they can use CO₂ as a carbon source and sunlight as an energy source, forming the foundational primary producers of a space bioeconomy [8]. Among cyanobacteria, the genus Anabaena (specifically strain PCC 7938, a non-heterocystous derivative of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120) presents a confluence of traits that make it an exceptional candidate chassis for space exploration, a proposition we will critically examine and substantiate throughout this review.

## 2. The Innate Astrobiological Advantages of Anabaena  *

### 2.1. Metabolic Autonomy: Photosynthesis and Nitrogen Fixation

The most compelling attribute of Anabaena is its metabolic self-sufficiency. It is one of the few prokaryotes capable of both oxygenic photosynthesis and atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) fixation.

*   **Oxygenic Photosynthesis:** Like plants and algae, Anabaena possesses Photosystems I and II, enabling it to split water, generate oxygen, and fix CO₂ into biomass using light energy [9]. This directly addresses two critical life support functions: oxygen production and carbon sequestration from crew respiration. The rate of oxygen production is directly coupled to light availability and cellular growth, offering a tunable system [10].
*   **Diazotrophy:** Unlike most model cyanobacteria (e.g., *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803), many Anabaena strains can fix N₂ gas into ammonia. While some strains do this in specialized, micro-oxic cells called heterocysts, strain PCC 7938 performs nitrogen fixation under micro-oxic conditions without differentiated heterocysts, simplifying its cultivation [11]. This capability is transformative for space applications, as it eliminates the need to supply fixed nitrogen fertilizers, which represent a significant mass penalty in resupply missions [12]. This dual autotrophy for carbon and nitrogen makes Anabaena a truly standalone primary producer.

### 2.2. Polyextremotolerance and Environmental Robustness

Space and planetary surfaces present a confluence of extreme conditions, including desiccation, nutrient scarcity, high salinity, and most notably, ionizing radiation and altered gravity. Anabaena exhibits a remarkable degree of inherent tolerance to these stresses.

*   **Radiation Resistance:** Cyanobacteria are generally more resistant to ionizing radiation than non-sporulating heterotrophic bacteria, a trait attributed to their efficient DNA repair machinery and antioxidant systems [13]. Anabaena sp. has been shown to survive and maintain metabolic activity after exposure to simulated Martian UV flux and gamma radiation doses that are lethal to many other microbes [14]. Its filamentous nature may also confer a survival advantage, allowing nutrient and signal sharing between damaged and healthy cells.
*   **Desiccation and Osmotic Tolerance:** In their natural habitats, cyanobacteria often endure cycles of desiccation and rehydration. Anabaena accumulates compatible solutes like sucrose and trehalose to protect cellular structures from dehydration-induced damage [15]. This desiccation tolerance is highly relevant for space applications, as it facilitates long-term storage and transport of strains as dried cultures, which can be rehydrated upon arrival [16].
*   **Response to Altered Gravity:** Studies on the International Space Station (ISS) and using ground-based simulators have yielded complex results. Some experiments show that *Synechocystis* and *Nostoc* (a close relative of Anabaena  *) exhibit enhanced growth and metabolic activity in microgravity or simulated microgravity [17]. The mechanisms are not fully understood but may involve improved gas exchange and nutrient availability in the absence of sedimentation and convection. However, long-term adaptation and potential genetic instability under spaceflight conditions remain active areas of investigation [18].

**Table 1: Comparative Advantages of Anabaena as a Space Chassis vs. Other Microbial Platforms.**

| Feature | Anabaena sp. | *Synechocystis* sp. (Cyanobacterium) | *E. coli* / *S. cerevisiae* (Heterotrophs) | Higher Plants (e.g., Lettuce) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Carbon Source** | CO₂ | CO₂ | Organic Carbon (e.g., Sugars) | CO₂ |
| **Nitrogen Source** | N₂ (Diazotrophic) | NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻ (Requires Fertilizer) | NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, Amino Acids | NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻ (Requires Fertilizer) |
| **Energy Source** | Light | Light | Organic Carbon | Light |
| **O₂ Production** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Edible Biomass** | Yes (Requires Processing) | Yes (Requires Processing) | No (S. cerevisiae: Yes) | Yes |
| **Genetic Tractability** | Good (Improving) | Excellent | Excellent | Poor / Complex |
| **Growth Rate** | Moderate | Fast | Very Fast | Slow |
| **Cultivation Volume** | Low (Liquid Culture) | Low (Liquid Culture) | Low (Liquid Culture) | High |
| **Radiation Tolerance** | High | Moderate | Low | Variable / Low |

### 2.3. Filamentous Morphology and Bioprocess Advantages

The multicellular, filamentous structure of Anabaena provides practical benefits for bioprocess engineering. Filaments can be easily separated from liquid culture via simple filtration or settling, reducing the energy and complexity required for biomass harvesting compared to unicellular cyanobacteria or microalgae [19]. This trait is particularly advantageous in microgravity, where centrifugal separators represent a single point of failure and add system mass. Furthermore, the filamentous form allows for the potential development of biofilm-based reactors, which can achieve high cell densities and stability [20].

## 3. Engineering Anabaena  *: From Wild Type to Cellular Factory

The wild-type metabolism of Anabaena provides a foundation, but its true potential for space is unlocked through metabolic engineering to overproduce target compounds. Significant progress has been made in developing the necessary genetic tools.

### 3.1. The Expanding Genetic Toolkit

Early genetic manipulation of Anabaena was challenging due to its complex cellular structure and restriction-modification systems. However, the field has advanced rapidly.

*   **Conjugation and Transformation:** Conjugal transfer from *E. coli* remains the most efficient method for introducing DNA into Anabaena [21]. Recent optimizations of electroporation protocols for strain PCC 7938 have increased transformation efficiency, streamlining the engineering process [22].
*   **Promoters and Expression Systems:** A library of constitutive and inducible promoters is now available. Native strong promoters like P*psbA* and P*cpcB* are commonly used, while synthetic promoters and riboswitches offer finer control over gene expression [23]. The recent development of a CRISPRi (CRISPR interference) system for Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 allows for targeted gene knockdowns, enabling sophisticated metabolic flux control without the need for gene knockouts [24].
*   **CRISPR-Cas for Genome Editing:** The adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a systems for precise genome editing in Anabaena marks a transformative leap [25]. This allows for efficient gene knock-ins, knock-outs, and point mutations, moving beyond the traditional reliance on homologous recombination and sacB counterselection, which were often inefficient and time-consuming.

### 3.2. Production of Target Molecules for Space Missions

Engineered Anabaena strains have been demonstrated to produce a range of high-value molecules directly relevant to space missions.

*   **Bioplastics:** Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biodegradable thermoplastic that can be used for 3D printing of tools and parts on-demand. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has been engineered to overproduce PHB by overexpressing the native *phbB* and *phbC* genes, achieving significant yields under nitrogen-deprived conditions [26]. In a space context, nitrogen deprivation is suboptimal; therefore, current research focuses on engineering strains that overproduce PHB under nitrogen-replete conditions, leveraging its diazotrophic capability.
*   **Nutraceuticals and Food Supplements:** Cyanobacterial biomass is rich in proteins and can be a source of essential amino acids. Furthermore, Anabaena has been engineered to produce the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the antioxidant pigment astaxanthin, both crucial for combating oxidative stress and maintaining astronaut health [27].
*   **Pharmaceuticals:** The *in-situ* production of pharmaceuticals is a critical capability for long-duration missions. Model compounds like the antipyretic salicylic acid have been produced in engineered Anabaena [28]. More ambitiously, research is underway to engineer pathways for complex therapeutics, such as vaccines or countermeasures for spaceflight-induced health issues (e.g., radiomitigators).

**Table 2: Engineered Products from Anabaena with Spaceflight Relevance.**

| Product Category | Specific Molecule | Engineering Strategy | Space Application | Current TRL* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biomaterials** | Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) | Overexpression of *phbBAC* operon | On-demand manufacturing via 3D printing | 3-4 |
| **Nutraceuticals** | Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA) | Heterologous expression of PKS pathway | Counteracting oxidative stress & inflammation | 2-3 |
| **Nutraceuticals** | Astaxanthin | Heterologous expression of *crt* genes | Antioxidant supplement | 2-3 |
| **Pharmaceuticals** | Salicylic Acid | Expression of bacterial *ics* gene | Analgesic and antipyretic drug | 2 |
| **Life Support** | Sucrose | Engineered secretion via a sucrose symporter | Recoverable carbon source for heterotrophs | 3 |

## 4. Systems Biology and Integration into Life Support

The engineering of Anabaena is increasingly guided by systems-level approaches. Genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets for Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and related strains are available, enabling the construction of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) [29]. These computational models allow researchers to predict the outcome of genetic manipulations on global metabolism and to identify optimal gene knockout or overexpression targets for maximizing the yield of desired products.

The ultimate value of Anabaena lies in its integration with other biological and physical systems. A proposed integrated Bio-ISRU system would function as follows:

1.  **Primary Production:** Engineered Anabaena is cultivated in photobioreactors (PBRs), consuming crew-respired CO₂, N₂ from the habitat atmosphere or local environment, and water (recycled or from regolith). It produces O₂ and biomass.
2.  **Biomass Processing:** The biomass is harvested. A fraction could be directly processed (e.g., lyophilized) as a nutritional supplement.
3.  **Downstream Biomanufacturing:** The bulk of the biomass is directed to downstream processes. It can be used as a feedstock for heterotrophic microorganisms (e.g., yeast, bacteria) engineered to produce more complex molecules, materials, or food items [30]. This creates a synergistic microbial food web.
4.  **Nutrient Recycling:** Waste streams from the crew and from bioprocessing (e.g., containing nitrogen and phosphorus) are recycled back into the Anabaena PBRs, closing the mass loops.

This integrated approach leverages the strengths of multiple biological systems while mitigating their individual limitations.

## 5. Challenges and Knowledge Gaps

Despite the promising outlook, significant scientific and engineering challenges must be overcome before Anabaena can become a reliable component of a life support system.

*   **Physiological Response to the Space Environment:** While short-term experiments are promising, data on the long-term (multi-generational) effects of the space environment on Anabaena are scarce. Key questions remain:
    *   **Genetic Stability:** Does microgravity or cosmic radiation induce elevated mutation rates or genomic instability [31]?
    *   **Metabolic Function:** How are carbon partitioning and nitrogen fixation efficiency affected over time? Transcriptomic and proteomic studies under simulated space conditions are needed [32].
    *   **Gravity Perception:** What are the molecular mechanisms by which cyanobacteria sense and respond to altered gravity? Understanding this is crucial for predicting and controlling their behavior [33].
*   **Photobioreactor Design and Operation:** Terrestrial PBR designs are not directly transferable to space. Key engineering challenges include:
    *   **Gas-Liquid Separation in Microgravity:** Efficient mass transfer of CO₂ and O₂ without buoyancy-driven convection requires novel reactor designs, such as membrane-based or capillary-based systems [34].
    *   **pH and Thermal Control:** The absence of natural convection complicates heat and pH management within the culture.
    *   **Reliability and Automation:** The system must operate autonomously for months or years with minimal maintenance, requiring robust sensors, control algorithms, and redundant systems.
*   **Contamination and Planetary Protection:** A monoculture of Anabaena in a closed system is vulnerable to contamination by other microbes. Strategies for sterility maintenance and contingency plans for culture crash recovery are essential. Furthermore, the use of Earth-originating organisms on other planetary bodies raises complex planetary protection concerns that must be addressed through international policy frameworks [35].

## 6. Perspective: The Roadmap to a Cyanobacterium-Powered Bioeconomy in Space (2024-2034)

The next decade will be decisive in transitioning Anabaena from a promising candidate to a validated technology for space exploration. We foresee several key trends and milestones.

*   **2024-2028: Ground-Based Validation and Strain Optimization.**
    *   Research will focus on creating "all-in-one" chassis strains optimized for space. Using advanced CRISPR-based multiplexed genome editing, we will see the creation of strains that simultaneously overproduce a bioplastic (e.g., PHB), secrete a carbohydrate (e.g., sucrose) for downstream heterotrophic fermentation, and produce a high-value nutraceutical (e.g., astaxanthin).
    *   Ground-based testing in increasingly flight-relevant PBR prototypes will mature the technology from TRL 3 to TRL 5/6. This includes long-duration (>>1 year) stability tests and integrated system demonstrations with downstream heterotrophic partners.

*   **2029-2032: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and Lunar Testing.**
    *   The ISS and future commercial space stations will serve as critical testbeds for validating Anabaena physiology and PBR performance in microgravity over multiple generations. These experiments must move beyond proof-of-concept to quantitative analysis of productivity, genetic stability, and life support functionality (O₂ production, CO₂ consumption rates).
    *   Lunar surface missions, potentially as part of the Artemis program, could host small, automated PBR payloads to test operation under partial gravity (1/6 g), intense radiation, and with real lunar regolith-derived water. This would represent the ultimate test of the Bio-ISRU concept's feasibility.

*   **2033-2034 and Beyond: Deployment for Martian Missions.**
    *   The knowledge gained from LEO and lunar experiments will inform the design of full-scale, human-rated life support systems for a Martian transit vehicle or surface habitat. We envision compact, multi-stage bioreactor systems where engineered Anabaena forms the primary production layer, supporting a suite of secondary heterotrophic biomanufacturing units.
    *   The focus will shift from pure biology to systems engineering: integration with habitat ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System), automation, and fail-safe operational protocols.

The primary challenge will be bridging the "valley of death" between successful laboratory demonstrations and flight-qualified, human-rated systems. This will require sustained, interdisciplinary collaboration between synthetic biologists, aerospace engineers, horticultural scientists, and mission planners. If these challenges can be met, engineered cyanobacteria like Anabaena will not merely be a component of life support; they will be the keystone of a sustainable, self-sufficient, and expanding human presence in the solar system.
